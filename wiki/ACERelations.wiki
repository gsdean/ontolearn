The goal of the Relation task is to detect and characterize Relations of the targeted Types between entities.  Relations are ordered pairs of entities.  This means that the order of the arguments is important in the identification of Relations.  To capture this idea, two different Argument slots (arg1 and arg2) are provided for each Relation.
